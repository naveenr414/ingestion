  formatted_text: This quantity can be measured with a Galilean device that relies
    on changes in liquid density. The surface form of this quantity is measured with
    a pyrometer. The first reliable tool for measuring this quantity was a sealed
    glass tube of (*) mercury. Absolute scales for this quantity include Rankine and
    Kelvin, and its standard scale is based on the freezing and boiling points of
    water. For ten points, name this quantity recorded in degrees Celsius.
